# FoodTracker
iOS app to rate meals from 0 to 5 stars that are displayed in a TableView, where you can choose to edit, delete, or add 
a new meal to rate. Developed using Apple's tutorial: Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift).

## I learned to:
- Use Xcode 
  - Navigate through it's interface
  - Add new files
  - Manage assets using XCAssets
- Use the Interface Builder
  - Add new objects to the storyboard
  - Create adaptive interfaces using Autolayout constraints
  - Use navigation controllers to manage the app's flow and add consistency to the app (New Meal scene)
  - Use segues to show different types of interactions
  - Be able to show and edit my custom object directly in the Storyboard
- Use Swift
  - Create custom classes (Meal)
  - Create custom objects (RatingControl)
  - Use the Photopicker (to choose an image for the meal)
  - Pass information between View Controllers
  - Use Table View Controller
    - Create a custom cell view with my custom object (RatingControler)
    - Use Table View Controller to manage the meals (edit and delete)
    - Add new elementes to the Table View Controller through a View Controller (MealViewController)
- Use the documentation to find the information I need.
- Persist data to save meals properties even after the app terminates
